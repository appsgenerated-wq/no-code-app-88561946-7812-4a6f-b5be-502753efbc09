- A running Manifest backend instance

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Manifest backend URL and App ID:
    ```
    VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-manifest-backend-url.vercel.app
    VITE_APP_ID=your-app-id
    ```

3.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Backend

The backend is defined by the `manifest.yml` file and is deployed via the Manifest platform. No additional backend setup is required.
